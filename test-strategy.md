# Test Strategy: Safeguru Website Automation

## **Overview**
This document outlines the test strategy for verifying the functionality of Safeguru.com using **Playwright** and **TypeScript**. The goal is to ensure key features like homepage functionality, search, product pages, cart operations, and performance meet expected standards.

---
## **Testing Approach**
We employ **automated functional testing** with **Playwright** to validate UI behavior and **end-to-end workflows**. The tests focus on:
1. **UI Verification** – Ensuring key elements are present and correctly displayed.
2. **Functional Testing** – Confirming that core website features operate as expected.
3. **Responsive Design Testing** – Checking mobile and desktop layout adaptability.
4. **Performance Testing** – Measuring page load speed and identifying bottlenecks.
5. **Error Handling** – Detecting broken links and console errors.

**Test Types Covered:**
- ✅ **Smoke Testing** – Basic checks on page load and critical elements.
- ✅ **Regression Testing** – Ensuring previous functionalities remain intact after updates.
- ✅ **End-to-End Testing** – Validating complete user journeys (e.g., searching and adding to cart).
- ✅ **Performance Testing** – Analyzing website speed and responsiveness.
- ✅ **Exploratory Testing** – Investigating unexpected behaviors.

## **Tools Used**
- **Playwright** – For browser automation and UI testing.
- **TypeScript** – Ensuring type safety and maintainable test scripts.
- **GitHub** – For version control and repository management.
- **Markdown (`.md`)** – For structured documentation (Bug Reports, Reflection).
- **Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge** – Cross-browser compatibility validation.
- **GitHub Actions** (Optional) – Running automated tests in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## **Assumptions**
- The test environment has **Playwright dependencies installed**.
- The **website remains accessible** during testing.
- Test cases assume **stable internet connectivity**.
- The search functionality should deliver **accurate results** based on user input.
- Users should be able to add, remove, and update items in the cart **without errors**.

---

## **Risks & Limitations**
- **Dynamic Content** – If Safeguru.com updates frequently, tests may require adjustments.
- **Network Dependency** – Performance tests depend on external factors like internet speed.
- **Third-Party Integrations** – Any API failures may impact test reliability.

---

## **Conclusion**
This strategy ensures **comprehensive coverage** of critical website features while maintaining **efficient automation** using Playwright. Regular **test updates** and monitoring will help detect issues early and maintain software reliability.
