# Work Reflection: Safeguru QA Automation Assessment

## **Approach to the Work**
I approached this assessment by first analyzing the websiteâ€™s core functionalities to ensure comprehensive test coverage. The focus was on automating key scenarios, including homepage validation, search results accuracy, product page details, cart interactions, and performance checks.  

To ensure reliability and scalability, I structured the project using **TypeScript** and **Playwright**, applying best practices such as:
- **Modular test scripts** to enhance maintainability.
- **Assertions** to verify UI elements and functionality.
- **Cross-browser compatibility checks** to ensure consistency.

GitHub was used for version control, tracking iterative improvements and maintaining clear documentation.

## **Challenges Faced & Solutions**
### **1. Handling Dynamic Elements (Search Suggestions)**
- **Issue:** Some UI elements, like **search suggestions**, appeared inconsistently.
- **Solution:** Implemented `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()` with proper delays to handle asynchronous loading.

### **2. Cart Functionality Issues**
- **Issue:** The "Add to Cart" button sometimes failed to register clicks during automated tests.
- **Solution:** Used `.click({ force: true })` in Playwright to ensure button interactions were executed correctly.

### **3. Performance Bottlenecks**
- **Issue:** Page load time exceeded acceptable limits in tests.
- **Solution:** Implemented **performance monitoring**, logging load times, and identifying slow-loading components.

### **4. Repository Organization**
- **Issue:** Maintaining a structured directory with **clear documentation**.
- **Solution:** Created folders for test cases, reports, and documentation to ensure clarity.

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Playwright is efficient for automation**, but handling dynamic content requires careful scripting.
- **Structured test design** ensures maintainability and scalability.
- **Clear documentation and version control** make collaboration and debugging smoother.

This assessment reinforced the importance of **robust automation, efficient debugging, and structured coding practices** for QA testing.
